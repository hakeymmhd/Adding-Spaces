# Adding-Spaces
Add spaces to the sentence in the variable “s” using the following rules until the length of
“s” equals to “width”.
When adding spaces, they should be added between the words equally. Any remaining
spaces that cannot be added equally will be added on the left most space then on the
right most space, then back to the second left most space then on the second right most
space and so on, towards the middle sentence.
Eg.
If “s” equals “This is the sentence to lengthen” and width equals 40, the
output should be
This□□□is□□□the□□sentence□□to□□□lengthen
(where each □ represents a space)
